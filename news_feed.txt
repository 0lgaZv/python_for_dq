Random Strawberry Pie------------
Ingredients for 4 portions:
All-purpose flour: 200 g
Granulated sugar: 80 g
Baking powder: 8 g
Salt: 2.0 g
Strawberry: 200 g
Unsalted butter (melted): 60 g
Milk: 60 g
Egg: 4
Ground cinnamon: 4 g (optional, for flavor)

Instructions:

Prepare the dough:
In a bowl, mix the flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, and cinnamon (if using).
Add strawberry and mix to combine.
Stir in the melted butter, milk, and egg (if using) to form a soft and slightly sticky dough.

Shape the 'pie':
Grease a small ramekin, pie dish, or ovenproof mug lightly with butter.
Pour or press the dough into the dish, spreading it evenly with a spoon.

Bake:
Preheat your oven to 180°C (350°F).
Bake for 40 minutes, or until the top is golden and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.
